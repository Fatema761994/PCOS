# PCOS

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a commonly reported endocrine disorder
in women of reproductive age, and such disorder is characterized by a number
of symptoms such as irregular menstrual cycles, hyperandrogenism, and poly-
cystic ovaries. Early detection and routine management of PCOS are essential
for avoiding long-term complications. Due to the variability and heterogeneity
of syndromes, the traditional diagnostic methods failed to detect PCOS more
accurately. This limitation enforced researchers to develop a novel framework
for detecting PCOS using reinforcement learning (RL) models enhanced with
optimized feature selectionâ€”marking one of the first comprehensive applications
of RL in PCOS diagnosis. This paper proposes an innovative approach for the
detection of PCOS using reinforcement learning (RL) models. The performance
of the RL based POCS model is further improved through the application of
an optimized feature selection technique which identify dominating features and
thereby improving the accuracy and interpretability of the model. The method was 
evaluated on a comprehensive dataset consisting of 541 patients, each with
43 different clinical and biochemical features. The experimental results demon-
strated that RL models, when combined with optimized feature selection, offer
competitive performance compared to traditional diagnostic methods. Although
the Deep Q-Network (DQN) achieved a strong performance with 96% accuracy,
97% precision, 92% recall, and a 94% F-score, it did not surpass the highest
accuracies reported in prior studies. However, the RL-based approach introduces
significant advantages in terms of adaptiveness, sequential decision-making, and
long-term optimization potential, highlighting its value as a flexible and intel-
ligent framework for PCOS diagnosis and beyond. These findings suggest that
reinforcement learning, when properly optimized, holds considerable promise as
a diagnostic tool for PCOS. The proposed method could provide a more accu-
rate, efficient, and scalable alternative to current diagnostic practices, with the
potential to significantly improve early detection and individualized treatment
strategies for women affected by PCOS.
